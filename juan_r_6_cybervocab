[So this has happened to me irl but i didn't fall for it kinda.] One day I was checking my e-mail, and i got and email from Amazon that 
a dude named Techsmartt (which is a famous youtuber) sent me $5 and a mesage that i didn't remember. but the layout of it looked a little 
weird i was like it does look a little weird but i clicked the link then i imedietly clicked off and checked the other amazon emails that 
people have sent me money and the email was different. but everything looked alright but i ddint put in my account info and all of that.
